# Routable-Discord-Bot
discord bots a different perspective.


as I was trying to improve my whitelist script tonight, there was a deficiency in eye discord.js 
and I wanted to approach the issue differently.
The base I bought was the routing 
structure of the web servers and I simply 
wrote a routable discord.js module. 
This means that you can build discord bot just by typing the route (object).
